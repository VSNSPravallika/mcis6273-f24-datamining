#### What is Data Mining?  
In the 1990’s “data mining” was an exciting and popular new concept. Around
2010, people instead started to speak of “big data.” Today, the popular term is
“data science.” However, during all this time, the concept remained the same:
use the most powerful hardware, the most powerful programming systems, and
the most efficient algorithms to solve problems in science, commerce, healthcare,
government, the humanities, and many other fields of human endeavor.  

Data mining is the process of searching and analyzing a large batch of raw data in order to identify patterns and extract useful information.
